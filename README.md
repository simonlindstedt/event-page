Hello 👋🏻

A collaboration between wu20 and ip20 with the purpose of building an event invitation.

We decided to create a fictitious open-mic festival for Kulturmejeriet.

# Code review by Evelyn
- Super easy to read CSS, kudos for using SASS
- Just like the CSS, the JavaScript used on this project is broken down into small, easy to read files
- Looks like the page is very SEO friendly
- Animations are pleasing to the eye and subtle
- I liked the dripping effect of the svg
- Overall, very good looking and well structured code
